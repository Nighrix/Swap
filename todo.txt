Bugs:

All {var accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()}  return the wrong address   -> web3 might connects to the wrong test net
-------------------------------------------------------------


Todo:
- Add an ABI link fetcher when a new tokens gets selected
- Get the liquidity of the tokens to calculate price impact (Add indicator at the bottom of the swap)
- Make the tokens that are already selected in one swap tab,     gray and not selectable


- onSelectToken() function currently sets symbol and name the same value (line 246,247)
- Save last used token address in the cookies, could use json or an array

- In the Select token window the x to close the tab should be replaced by an image
